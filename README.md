## Introduction

With the increasing prevalence of automated bot traffic on websites, it has become essential to detect and mitigate bot activities to maintain the integrity of web analytics and enhance security. This project focuses on analyzing IBM's web traffic data to detect bot activities using Power BI and machine learning techniques.

## Objectives

- **Analyze Web Traffic Data**: Understand the patterns and characteristics of IBM's web traffic.
- **Visualize Bot Activity**: Create dynamic dashboards to monitor bot activity trends.
- **Improve Detection Accuracy**: Enhance bot detection accuracy by 25% using advanced analytics.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models to identify the best fit.

## Data Description

The dataset includes web traffic logs from IBM's website, containing:

- **Session Data**: Information about user sessions.
- **User Agent Strings**: Identifying the browser and device types.
- **IP Addresses**: Anonymized for privacy.
- **Request Patterns**: Details about page requests and frequency.
- **Timestamp Data**: Timestamps of user interactions.

*Note: Due to confidentiality, the actual dataset is not included in this repository.*

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**: For data import, processing, visualization, and DAX calculations.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating custom measures and calculated columns.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Logistic Regression Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier

## Project Workflow

### Data Import and Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed null values and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.
- **Normalization**: Standardized data formats for consistency.
- **Data Transformation**: Converted data types and created calculated columns.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Studied session durations, page views, and user behavior.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identified outliers and unusual patterns indicative of bot activity.
- **Visualization**: Used charts and graphs to represent data distributions and relationships.

### Feature Engineering

- **Request Rate**: Calculated the number of requests per session.
- **Session Frequency**: Measured how often sessions occurred from the same IP.
- **User Agent Analysis**: Parsed user agent strings to identify bots.

### Model Development

- **Decision Tree**:

  - Provided interpretability.
  - Identified key features affecting bot detection.
  - Achieved an accuracy of 85%.

- **Logistic Regression**:

  - Served as a baseline model.
  - Simplicity and quick computation.
  - Achieved an accuracy of 78%.

- **Random Forest**:

  - Offered high accuracy and robustness.
  - Reduced overfitting.
  - Achieved an accuracy of 90%.

### Dashboard Creation

- **Automated Dashboards**: Created interactive visuals that update in real-time.
- **Bot Activity Trends**: Line charts showing bot activity over time.
- **Top Suspicious IPs**: Tables listing IPs with high bot scores.
- **Geographical Mapping**: Visual maps indicating regions with high bot activity.
- **Bot vs. Human Traffic**: Comparative analysis using pie charts and bar graphs.

## Results and Findings

- **Random Forest Model Selected**: Outperformed other models with a 90% accuracy rate.
- **Key Indicators**:

  - High request rates and low session durations are strong indicators of bot activity.
  - Certain user agents are more commonly associated with bots.

- **Visual Insights**:

  - Identified peak bot activity periods.
  - Detected geographical hotspots for bot traffic.

## Conclusion

The project successfully identified and visualized bot activities within IBM's web traffic data. By applying advanced analytics and machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest classifier, the detection accuracy was significantly improved. The automated Power BI dashboards provide valuable real-time insights, aiding in proactive bot management.
